            <h2>Diaz Family Memories</h2>
            <p>Obedience helps make such good memories. The Book of Mormon is full of accounts of the blessings that come from obedience to the laws of the Lord and the destruction which is associated with disobedience, as is evidenced by Lehi’s journey toward the promised land. Obedience brings instruments, tools, direction, food, and peace to his family. Disobedience brings heartache, suffering, and turmoil.

                <h2>First Time in The Montreal Temple</h2>
                <p>
                    In the temples members of the Church who make themselves eligible can participate in the most exalted of the redeeming ordinances that have been revealed to mankind. 
                    There, in a sacred ceremony, an individual may be washed and anointed and instructed and endowed and sealed. And when we have received these blessings for ourselves
                     we may officiate for those who have died without having had the same opportunity.

                <h2>Caracas</h2>
                <p>I was born in Caracas, Venezuela. Caracas is the capital and largest city of Venezuela, and the center of the Metropolitan Region of Caracas (or Greater Caracas).Caracas is located along the Guaire River in the northern part of the country, within the Caracas Valley of the Venezuelan coastal mountain range (Cordillera de la Costa). The valley is close to the Caribbean Sea, separated from the coast by a steep 2,200-meter-high (7,200 ft) mountain range, Cerro El Ávila; to the south there are more hills and mountains. The Metropolitan Region of Caracas has an estimated population of almost 5 million inhabitants.
