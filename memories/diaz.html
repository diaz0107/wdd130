            <h2>Diaz Family Memories</h2>
            <p>My main goal is to create an effective Personal Site to gather my wife Maria and me the moments as a Member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to share with our Grandchildren. 
                You might think of your spiritual memories this way. With constant prayer, a determination to keep our covenants, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, we navigate our way through life. And when someone sets their defining memories aside and is lost or confused, we turn them toward the Savior as we share our faith and memories with them, helping them rediscover those precious spiritual moments they once treasured..</p>

                <h2>First Time in The Montreal Temple</h2>
                <p>In the temples, we, as members of the Church, make ourselves eligible to participate in the most exalted of the redeeming ordinances revealed to humankind.
                The LDS Temple brings peace to our souls. It brings peace to our souls, not the peace provided by men, but the peace promised by the Son of God when He said, “Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.”

                <h2>Caracas</h2>
                <p>I was born in Caracas, Venezuela. Caracas is the capital and largest city of Venezuela, and the center of the Metropolitan Region of Caracas (or Greater Caracas).Caracas is located along the Guaire River in the northern part of the country, within the Caracas Valley of the Venezuelan coastal mountain range (Cordillera de la Costa). The valley is close to the Caribbean Sea, separated from the coast by a steep 2,200-meter-high (7,200 ft) mountain range, Cerro El Ávila; to the south there are more hills and mountains. The Metropolitan Region of Caracas has an estimated population of almost 5 million inhabitants.
