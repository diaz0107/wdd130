                    <h2>Our Wedding Reception</h2>
                    <p>
                        A wedding reception is a party usually held after the completion of a marriage ceremony as hospitality for those who have attended the wedding, hence the name reception: the couple receive society, in the form of family and friends, for the first time as a married couple. Hosts provide their choice of food and drink, although a wedding cake is popular.

                <h2>Ottawa</h2>
                <p>
                    Ottawa is the capital city of Canada. Located on the south bank of the Ottawa River in the southern portion of the province of Ontario, Ottawa borders Gatineau, Quebec, and forms the core of the Ottawa–Gatineau census metropolitan area (CMA) and the National Capital Region (NCR).[14] As of 2021, Ottawa had a city population of 1,017,449 and a metropolitan population of 1,488,307, making it the fourth-largest city and fourth-largest metropolitan area in Canada.

                    Founded in 1826 as Bytown, and incorporated as Ottawa in 1855,[15] the city has evolved into the political centre of Canada. The federal government is the largest employer in the region, having a strong presence on the local economic makeup. Its original boundaries were expanded through numerous annexations and were ultimately replaced by a new city incorporation and amalgamation in 2001 which significantly increased its land area. The municipal government is established and governed by the City of Ottawa Act of the Government of Ontario, and has an elected city council across 23 wards and a mayor elected city-wide.
