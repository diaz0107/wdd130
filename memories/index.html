                    <h2>Our Wedding Reception</h2>
                        <p>We were sealed at the Toronto, Ontario Temple. It was on a Ward Trip and we had about 50 members from our Fallowfield Ward! It was a wonderful experience. “The Family: A Proclamation to the World” states that “marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator’s plan for the eternal destiny of His children” 
                        Life’s greatest joys are found in a loving family. This is so in spite of the many distractions and challenges of life. Building strong families requires efforts. But such effort can bring joy in this life and through all eternity.                       
                        In our Heavenly Father’s plan of happiness, a husband and wife can be together forever. The authority to unite families forever is called the sealing power.

                <h2>Ottawa</h2>
                <p>
                    We live in Ottawa, Canada. Ottawa is the capital city of Canada. Located on the south bank of the Ottawa River in the southern portion of the province of Ontario, Ottawa borders Gatineau, Quebec, and forms the core of the Ottawa–Gatineau census metropolitan area and the National Capital Region. As of 2021, Ottawa had a city population of 1,017,449 and a metropolitan population of 1,488,307, making it the fourth-largest city and fourth-largest metropolitan area in Canada.

                    Founded in 1826 as Bytown, and incorporated as Ottawa in 1855, the city has evolved into the political centre of Canada.
