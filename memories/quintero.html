                <h2>Quintero Family Memories</h2>
                <p> We believe we lived with God before we were born. We were spirits there, and in order to gain our bodies and to have special experiences necessary for our eternal salvation, we need to come to earth. That means each spirit needs a family to come to. For this reason, LDS are encouraged to have children if they are able to do so. However, this does not equate to having dozens of them. The church’s official statement on birth control says:

                    Mormon family at family night.“Children are one of the greatest blessings in life, and their birth into loving and nurturing families is central to God’s purposes for humanity. When husband and wife are physically able, they have the privilege and responsibility to bring children into the world and to nurture them. The decision of how many children to have and when to have them is a private matter for the husband and wife.”

                    <h3>The Quintero Family</h3>
                    <p>In Here my family and I we were in Santa Teresa at my Mom's house, who crossed the vail in 2012, we were cooking a Sancocho. This delicious and easy to make Venezuelan Sancocho is filled with vegetables, starches and hearty beef! Perfect Sunday dish to enjoy with family and friends.
                        spend a lot of time as a family. They have a family night once a week, daily prayer and scripture study as a family, church attendance together, and many other family-oriented activities. They can’t imagine Heaven without their families. Because they are encouraged to notice the blessings family life brings, they are more likely to enjoy a houseful of children and all the fun chaos that goes with it.
