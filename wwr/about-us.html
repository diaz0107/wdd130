                <p> Thank you for considering us among your choices of whitewater adventure / vacation destinations. Know that for us, Rafting is not only a party on the river but also a party at the end of the evening where friends, adrenaline and humour are gathering! For us, Rafting is THE best way to celebrate our friendships. Because when we plan on such a day, we want to call those we see often and those we would like to see more often. <br>
                </p>
                <h2>Why choose us?</h2>
                <p> Apart from our philosophy: "Our place is yours!" and the fact that we take our time on the river, let me list a few factors that we think are important.
                 First, the Ottawa River is the best rafting river in Canada! <br><br>It offers a ‚Äú2 for 1‚Äù; it splits into two main channels and each one runs alongside each other and offers very high quality rapids. When the water is high, we take the ‚ÄúMiddle‚Äù section as it offers more rapids. When the water goes down, we take the ‚ÄúMain‚Äù one because it becomes the most interesting Rafting option.
                 When the water level is in between and we are unsure of the best option‚Ä¶ well, we take both channels! By the way, we are the only company on the river that acts this way üòâ
